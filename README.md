# Smart Attendance System 🎓📸

This project is a **Smart Attendance System** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **CSV** for storing attendance records. It uses face detection and recognition to mark attendance automatically when a known face is detected.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – for face detection and recognition
- **NumPy** – for array manipulation and model training
- **CSV** – to store attendance logs

## 📌 Features
- Real-time face detection using your webcam
- Face recognition with automatic attendance logging
- CSV-based record-keeping (Name, Date, Time)
- Easy to extend and integrate with other systems (like messaging or databases)

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Capture face images of students and label them.
2. **Training**: Use OpenCV's LBPH face recognizer to train the model.
3. **Recognition**: Detect and recognize faces in real-time video stream.
4. **Attendance Logging**: When a face is recognized, the system logs the name and timestamp in a CSV file.
